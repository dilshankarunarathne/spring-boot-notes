# Spring Boot

## Spring Framework 

* Framework for providing comprehensive infastructural support for developing Java Applications.  

* Object-Oriented Programming best practices built in  
Spring is built on solid Object-Oriented programming concepts, and its style promotes the users to do the same thing when consuming the framework.  

* DRY Principles - Don't Repeat Yourself  
Spring promotes DRY Principle. By leveraging the powerful abstractions of the framework, instead of rebuilding the scaffolding, we can focus on the actual needs of our application.   

Spring framework is built and designed to provide comprehensive support when developing applications for the JVM. Including abstractions for some of the most powerful and common enterprice integrations, specifically around common infastructure.  
Spring essentially is designed to provide the plumbing for using these enterprice authoring in common components used in both internet and enterprice applications.  
This plumbings allows us to easily consume these authorings while focusing on the business logics.  

 



### Definitions 

* POJO - Plain Old Java Objects  
In Spring, this is any class that contains both attributes and methods. And those methods are not just getters and setters.
